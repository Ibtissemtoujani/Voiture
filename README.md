DevOps process :

During the DevOps process I will use :
	
-  Github as a git repo for my application ( you can find the depo of my Application under https://github.com/Ibtissemtoujani/Voiture).

-  Jenkins as a CI/ CD tool,

-  Selenium for continuous testing

-  Docker in order to containerize the application,

-  Openshift and Kubernetes to orchestrate containers,

-  Kibana in order to track my App as a monitoring tool,

⇒ Until this point my App is fonctionnel on my Windows machine, I’m trying to adapt it to work smoothly on my ubuntu machine,
